It provides real-time exercise posture monitoring using MediaPipe Pose, counts repetitions, gives audio feedback for incorrect posture, and recommends meals based on the user’s calorie needs. The system includes exercise tutorials, a virtual trainer, and a simple diet recommendation engine using curated food datasets.
